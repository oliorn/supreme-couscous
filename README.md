1. Project Goal
The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive test environment in Google Cloud that
simulates realistic use cases for evaluating the Virkum Respond system. This includes setting up
virtual companies whose knowledge base is built on data from real websites. This environment will
be used to send simulated emails to these virtual companies, enabling the Virkum Respond system
to generate response drafts which can then be systematically captured and evaluated. Special
emphasis will be placed on the development of evaluation tools to assess the quality of these drafts
and on conducting load tests to evaluate the system's performance and scalability.

3. Detailed Description
  Students will design and develop a test environment consisting of the following components:
    • Simulated Companies: Setting up virtual companies where knowledge data is scraped and
  processed from the public websites of real companies to build a realistic knowledge base.
    • Simulated Customers: Creating a system that sends a variety of emails to the simulated
  companies, triggering Virkum Respond to generate answers for evaluation.
    • Automation and Load Testing: Developing tools that perform automated tests on the
  Virkum Respond system, log results, and conduct systematic load tests to identify system
  limits and performance.
    • Evaluation Tools: Designing and building evaluation tools that compare the response drafts
  generated by Virkum Respond against expectations and assess their quality using similarity
  metrics and text analysis.
  The project is directly related to the development and quality assurance of the company's core
  solution, Virkum Respond. The target audience for the project is the Virkum development team,
  which needs to regularly verify the system's functionality and performance.
  4. Project Deliverables
  By the end of the project, the following will be ready:
    • A flexible test environment in Google Cloud that allows for the addition of new simulated
  companies and test cases.
    • Tools with a CLI or a simple user interface to manage tests and run load tests.
    • Developed evaluation tools for analyzing the accuracy and quality of automated responses.
    • Detailed documentation on the setup, use of the system, and the results from the load tests

4. Development Environment and Technology
  The following technologies and tools are recommended for the project:
    • Cloud Service: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    • Programming Language: Python (along with LangGraph and FastAPI stubs)
    • Web Scraping: BeautifulSoup or Playwright
    • Vector Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector or MongoDB
    • Load Testing: Custom-built Python programs or tools
    • Version Control: GitHub
5. Student Facilities
  Students can carry out the project remotely. Data, API keys, and access to the testing
  environment will be provided as needed.
6. Skill Requirements
  Students should have:
    • Good knowledge of Python programming.
    • Basic skills in data processing and an understanding of web technologies.
    • The ability to work independently, document their work, and deliver organized code.
    • An interest in cloud solutions, testing methodologies, artificial intelligence, and real-world
  use cases.
7. About the Company
  Virkum is an innovation company developing the Virkum Respond solution. The solution uses
  artificial intelligence to draft automated email responses based on the predefined style and
  knowledge of each company
